# Pascal-Compiler

This project is a simple compiler written in C that performs:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (recursive descent parsing)
- Intermediate code generation (pseudo-code output)

---

## Files

- `main.c` – the compiler source code
- `test.txt` – input file (your source code to compile)
- `codepile.txt` – output file (generated pseudo-code)

## How to Compile and Run

### 1. Compile:

```bash
gcc main.c -o compiler
